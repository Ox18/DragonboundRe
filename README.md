# DragonboundRE (v133)

DragonboundRE is a project for educational purposes to learn more about Reverse Engineering in a web environment. The main goal of this project is to create a functional mock client that can be used to understand WebSocket based architectures. This can be used to get much better practice on developing applications with real-time data exchange.

> **Why Dragonbound?**  
> Because Dragonbound is inspired by an old and fun game that is long gone. Another reason is that the animations used in this game [in the case of buttons, explosions and others] looks like a paper without animation.

## Projects

This repository consists of two projects.

### - [Dragonbound.Server](https://github.com/Ox18/DragonboundRe/tree/remake/Dragonbound.Server)

This is the server emulator, where the data of what the client does is shared.

### - [Dragonbound.Client](https://github.com/Ox18/DragonboundRe/tree/remake/Dragonbound.Client)

This is the project where the client will connect to the game.

## Instructions

### Install the necessary dependencies for both projects

Open a terminal in each of the Client and Server project folders.
Make sure you have installed NodeJS before.
After that, in the terminal run the following command:

```npm i```

or if you use yarn

```yarn```

### Execute projects

There is nothing more to do, just run the projects in a terminal each, with the command:

```npm run start```

o

```yarn start```

Personally, I prefer to use YARN for the effectiveness and speed it brings when installing dependencies but, the use of package manager is at your discretion.
After going through several projects trying to do the same project, they lack objectivity and make the project a disaster.
This project tries to solve the errors that present those other private servers that have a lot of failures. I am open to any idea or suggestion.
